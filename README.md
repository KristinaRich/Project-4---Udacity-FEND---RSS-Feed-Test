# Project Scope
This project for the Frontend Web Development Nanodegree (Udacity) should provide tests for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds using Jasmine framework. It contains following tests:
#### RSS Feed
 * Are the feeds defined?
 * Are the feed URL defined?
 * Are the feed names defined?
#### The Menu 
 * Is the menu hidden?
 * Does the menu toggle on/off after click on it?
#### Initial Entries
 * Is an entry displayed?
 * Is the content changing?

# Resources
Udacity provided the code, all neccessary files to run the application and an initial test code to define the feeds. In order to prepare for this task, I studied  following resources prior to write the code:
